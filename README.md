grails-versions
---

Handy repo/script to compare fresh `create-app` versions of Grails 3 so you can see what changed.

Just compare across tags:
* <https://github.com/erichelgeson/grails-versions/compare/3.1.7...3.1.8>
* <https://github.com/erichelgeson/grails-versions/compare/3.2.0...3.2.11>
* <https://github.com/erichelgeson/grails-versions/compare/3.3.9...4.0.3>

From the git cli:

```bash
git diff 4.0.0..4.0.3
```
